                      <p>One of the many culinary gems to come out of French Canada, poutine is perhaps one of the country’s most outlandish and defining dishes. Several small towns in Quebec claim to have invented this celebrated dish (or side dish), and it’s said to date back to the 1950s. A real poutine uses peppery meat-based gravy and “squeaky” curds on fries.</p>
                      <p>Where to eat it: Any Canadian diner with fries on the menu will typically offer poutine, including big chains like McDonald’s. Franchises like Smoke’s Poutinerie serve up just about any protein or vegetable in the calorie-heavy dish. If you’re up for a real celebration, there are also annual poutine festivals in cities across the country.</p>

                      <p>What’s known in our country as “peameal bacon” is branded as Canadian bacon just about everywhere else. Unlike traditional bacon, which comes from the pig’s belly, Canadian bacon is lean pork loin that’s been brined and rolled in cornmeal. During the turn of the century, Canada would export its pork to England, which was experiencing a shortage. At the time it was rolled in yellow peas for preservation, though over the years, that switched to cornmeal.</p>
                      <p>Where to eat it: Carousel Bakery in Toronto’s St. Lawrence Market is world-renowned for its Canadian bacon sandwiches, though they insist on calling them World Famous Peameal Bacon Sandwiches.</p>

                      <p>Invented in 1969 by Calgary restaurant manager Walter Chell, this cocktail took off to become enormously popular from there. (Clamato-maker Mott’s claims more than 350-million Caesars are sold every year.) Its key ingredients are clamato juice, vodka, Worchester and a salted rim.</p>
                      <p>Where to eat it: Although the Caesar is considered a cocktail, one Vancouver restaurant has turned it into a meal. Score on Davie offers the “Checkmate Caesar,” which is garnished with a full roast chicken, cheeseburger, chicken wings, pulled pork mac and cheese hot dog, roasted vegetables and a brownie.</p>

                      <p>Ron Telesky is a pizza joint in Berlin, which offers up “Canadian-style” pizza. When one of the owners did a high school exchange in Peterborough, Ontario, he was impressed with the style of pizza they served in his surrogate home. It wasn’t quite as fried and doughy as American style, yet the toppings were more inventive than traditional Italian-style pies. The resulting pizza at Ron Telesky’s is somewhere in-between: a thin-crust pizza with an array of creative pizzas toppings. Flavours include Cronenberg Crash (cilantro pesto, tandoori tofu, mango, peanuts and red pepper) and the Wayne Gretzky.</p>
                      <p>Where to eat it: Ron Telesky’s is located in the Kreuzberg neighbourhood in Berlin.</p>
